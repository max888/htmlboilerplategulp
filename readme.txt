This is a boilerplate for simple html sites. Used for prototyping etc.

1.) $ npm install to install npm and dependencies locally.

2.) 'gulp dev' to watch SCSS and JS folder files. SCSS is compiled into css/pages.css. Js is compiled into js/app.js. They are not minified when working in dev. Other gulp tasks are visible in the gulpfile.js file.
BrowserSync will serve files at localhost:3000

3.) To minify for production run 'gulp dist'. Files will be output to the dist folder.
